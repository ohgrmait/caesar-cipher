## About
`caesar-cipher` is a classic "intro to programming problem" wherein the method `caesar_cipher(string, shift_factor)` takes in a string and the shift factor and thhen outputs the modified string using a right shift.[^1]

[^1]: [This project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-caesar-cipher) is from the [Ruby Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby) in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about).

## Self Reflections
- > I ended up choosing the [Full Stack Ruby on Rails](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails) path. As a result, I've started with the [Ruby Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby) and learned quite a lot of things like basic data types, variables, input and output, conditional logic, loops, arrays, hashes, methods, debugging, basic and predicate enumerable methods, and nested collections.
